# Azure Machine Learning End-To-End Tutorials

This example shows you generic AI / ML workflow through lifecycle - exploration, train, tune, and publishing - with Azure Machine Learning (AML) API.<br>
(I assume that the framework **TensorFlow version 1.x** is used in our code.)

There exist 2 options to run Azure Machine Learning (AML) API - Python SDK and CLI/YAML.

- [Exercise00 : Set up Environment](./notebooks/exercise00_setup_sdk.md)
- [Exercise01 : Prepare Config Settings](./notebooks/exercise01_prepare_config.ipynb)

> Note : You can also use raw REST API for involing AML API.
