# Azure Machine Learning Hands-On all for TensorFlow 1.x

This sample shows how to use Azure Machine Learning (formerly, Azure Machine Learning service) using TensorFlow along with the entire development lifecycle (explore data, train, tune, and publish).

You can get [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset (**train.tfrecords**, **test.tfrecords**) in this example by running [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/master/tensorflow/examples/how_tos/reading_data/convert_to_records.py), and put these files into ```data``` folder.

> Note : In this Hands-on Labs, I'm using TensorFlow 1.x, however, now Azure Machine Learning supports TensorFlow 2.0 with eager execution.

Before starting, you must provision your environment as follows :

> Note : Here we setup our own notebook environment, but you can also run AML SDK on [Azure Notebook](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks/blob/master/NBSETUP.md) or [AML Hosted Notebook VM (Virtual Machine)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/tutorial-1st-experiment-sdk-setup). However, Execise03 couldn't run on Azure Notebook, since TensorFlow version is old (TensorFlow 1.1.0) in the Notebook kernel.

## 1. Setup your Virtual Machine and Conda Env

- Create "[Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM) on Ubuntu](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-en/marketplace/apps/microsoft-dsvm.linux-data-science-vm-ubuntu)" using [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/)    
  Here we use DSVM, in which Python and Conda has already installed, but you can also build your own environment from scratch. (DSVM also includes Azure ML CLI.)

- Create conda virtual environment and activate as follows.

```
conda create -n myenv -y Python=3.6
conda activate myenv
```

- Install required packages in your conda environment with required extensions. (You must run in your conda env.)    
```azureml-sdk[notebooks]``` installs notebook in your conda env and ```azureml_widgets``` extension is enabled in Jupyter. This extension is needed in Exercise 06.    
See "[Install the Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/overview/azure/ml/install?view=azure-ml-py)" for other extensions. (Run ```jupyter nbextension list``` for seeing installed extensions in your environment.)

```
# install AML SDK
pip install azureml-sdk[notebooks]

# install notebook integration for conda
conda install nb_conda

# install required packages for development
# (use "tensorflow-gpu" if using GPU VM)
conda install -y matplotlib tensorflow==1.15
```

## 2. Create Azure ML Resource

Create new "Machine Learning" resource in [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) .    
Please make sure that **you specify location (region) which supports NC-seriese (K80 GPU) virtual machines in resource creation**, because this resource location is used for VM location when you create AML compute resources (virtual machines) in AML Python SDK. (See [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/services/?products=virtual-machines) for supported regions.)

## 3. Start Jupyter Notebook

- Clone this repo in your environment.

```
git clone https://github.com/tsmatz/azure-ml-tensorflow-complete-sample.git
```

- Start jupyter notebook server in your conda environment.

```
jupyter notebook
```

- Copy url for notebook in the console output, and set SSH tunnel (port forwarding) on your desktop to access notebook.   
  For instance, the following picture is the SSH tunnel setting on "putty" terminal client in Windows. (You can use ```ssh -L``` option in Mac OS.)    
  ![SSH Tunnel settings with putty](https://tsmatz.github.io/images/github/azure-ml-tensorflow-complete-sample/20191225_SSH_Tunnel.jpg)

- Open your notebook url (http://localhost:8888/?token=...) using web browser in your desktop.

- Create new notebook by selecting "Python 3" kernel (which is your current conda environment).

Now you're ready to start !
